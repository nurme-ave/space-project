## Overview

### Project Description

I was taking a more into-depth look into HTML Forms on Scrimba - a course taught by the CSS evangelist Kevin Powell. To make the knowledge stick I decided to create a form of my own. I didn't just want to build another plain form and wished to have a bit of context or a short story around so I ended up with this humorous content. I also used a video background here which adds quite a bit to the whole look and feel of the website.

Here I learned that Forms and Mobile Viewports can be a bit of a headache. When we input our data into forms on mobile the mobile keyboard opens up and that can mess up the layout a bit, sometimes even covering up the form. In my case the form was visible but it squeezed the other paragraphs tightly into each other. Since I had the CSS 'overflow' property originally set to 'hidden', I just removed it altogether. I also added a bit of code that fixes the issue with mobile viewport at 'height: 100vh'.

In addition how to create and style a HTML Form I also learned a new JavaScript trick - FormData.get() - which returns the first value associated with a given key from within a FormData object.

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.
