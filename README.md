## Overview

### Project Description

I wanted to get a better understanding of HTML forms and watched a tutorial at Scrimba taught by Kevin Powell. After watching the video tutorials I decided it would be wise to get some hands-on experience and create a simple form of my own. Well...my creativity started to fly and this simple form turned out into a small project with implementing background videos and lots of humour :-). It helps a lot when learning is fun :-).

The page is fully responsive.
